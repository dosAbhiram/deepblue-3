                  “Corautus is a biotechnology company focused on the treatment
                  of advanced cardiovascular disease. We needed a new corporate
                  look and web design that was reflective of the company and its
                  advancements in the field. We chose DEEPBLUE based upon their
                  strong design experience and the consultative assistance
                  provided during the discovery phase. The rapid response to our
                  needs clearly put DEEPBLUE ahead of the competition. We have
                  been very pleased with the quality of their work and the high
                  level of customer service. I would strongly recommend them.”
